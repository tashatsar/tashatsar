### 👋 Hi and welcome here! I’m @tashatsar: a data scientist and just a simple human being 😊

- 👀 I’m interested in DS, MLOps, Python and programming: have been working in the field of Data Analysis, Data Science and MLOps for more than five years
- ❤️ My key values are curiosity, continuous learning and passion for what I do. Why data science is so amazing for me? 
Because there is always a lot of new things to learn and to apply in practice!
- ✨ In my free time I like to learn new things, play Nethack, travel and learn languages  
- 📫 In case of any questions you can contact me via telegram [@tashatsar](https://t.me/tashatsar) or [LinkedIn](#https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsarkova/)
